## list_files
Description: Request to list files and directories within the specified directory. If recursive is true, it will list all files and directories recursively. If recursive is false or not provided, it will only list the top-level contents. Do not use this tool to confirm the existence of files you may have created, as the user will let you know if the files were created successfully or not.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to list contents for (relative to the current working directory {{cwd}})
- recursive: (optional) Whether to list files recursively. Use true for recursive listing, false or omit for top-level only.
Usage:
<list_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<recursive>true or false (optional)</recursive>
</list_files>

Example: Requesting to list all files in the current directory
<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>false</recursive>
</list_files>

## list_code_definition_names
Description: Request to list definition names (classes, functions, methods, etc.) used in source code files at the top level of the specified directory. This tool provides insights into the codebase structure and important constructs, encapsulating high-level concepts and relationships that are crucial for understanding the overall architecture.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory (relative to the current working directory {{cwd}}) to list top level source code definitions for.
Usage:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>Directory path here</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

Example: Requesting to list all top level source code definitions in the current directory
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>.</path>
</list_code_definition_names>
